# steamstreaming

A nascent Rust crate that implements the Steam in-home streaming protocol.

Much of this implementation was derived from the information in these blog posts[[1]](https://codingrange.com/blog/steam-in-home-streaming-discovery-protocol)[[2]](https://codingrange.com/blog/steam-in-home-streaming-control-protocol) as well as [this C# library](https://github.com/DevinWatson/SteamStreamingLibrary/).
